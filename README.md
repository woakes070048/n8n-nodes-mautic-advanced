# n8n Mautic Advanced Node

[![Buy Me A Coffee](https://img.shields.io/badge/Buy%20Me%20A%20Coffee-Support-yellow.svg)](https://buymeacoffee.com/msoukhomlinov)

> **Note:** This is an **unofficial** community node, not affiliated with or endorsed by n8n GmbH. It was built on the back of n8n's official Mautic node because the official node does not provide the API coverage needed for many real-world Mautic workflows (e.g. notes, users, roles, stats, themes, emails, fields, notifications, advanced filtering, and more).

Enhanced n8n node for Mautic with comprehensive API coverage including tags, campaigns, categories, notifications, and advanced contact management.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Could not get parameter 'options'" Error
**Cause**: Missing Options parameter in node definition
**Solution**: Update to latest version (0.3.2+) which includes all required Options parameters

#### Authentication Errors
**Cause**: Incorrect credentials or URL
**Solution**: 
- Verify Mautic URL format (https://your-mautic.com)
- Check API credentials are active
- Ensure proper permissions for API access

#### Date Filter Issues
**Cause**: Incorrect date format
**Solution**: Use YYYY-MM-DD format for date filters
